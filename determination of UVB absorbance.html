							<h1>Determination of the UVB absorbance and the sun protection factors (SPF) of anthocyanin and quercetin solutions</h1>
                            <h2>Procedures</h2>
                            <p>0.1 mg/ml quercetin solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of quercetin hydrate in 100 ml of 99.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). 0.1 mg/ml anthocyanin solution was prepared by dissolving 10 mg of Chinese bilberry extract, containing 25% anthocyanin, in 100 ml of sterile water. The solutions were scanned in the range 290-320 nm, the wavelengths of UVB, in the UV-absorption spectrophotometer and absorbance values at intervals of 5 nm were recorded. The sun protection factors (SPF) of the solutions were then calculated using the formula by Mansur, Breder, Mansur and Azulay (1986). </p> 
                            <h2>Results:</h2>
                            <p>Figure 1 shows the  UVB-absorbances of anthocyanin from 290-320 nm, which were found to be relatively high. UVB-absorbance of anthocyanin was highest at 290 nm and gradually decreased as wavelength increased to 320 nm.</p>
                             <span class="symbol"><img src="images/figure%201.jpg"/></span><p>Figure 2 shows the UVB-absorbances of quercetin from 290-320 nm, which were found to be higher than that of anthocyanin. UVB-absorbance of anthocyanin increased gradually from 290 and peaked at 305 nm, and gradually decreased as wavelength increased to 320 nm.</p>
                             <span class="symbol"><img src="images/figure%202.jpg"/></span>
                            <p>Figure 3 shows the sun protection factors (SPF) of the anthocyanin and quercetin solutions, which were calculated using the formula by Mansur et al. (1986) based on the UVB-absorbances of quercetin and anthocyanin obtained. The Mann-Whitney test was performed and the p-value obtained was 0.000, which is less than 0.05, indicating significant statistical difference. Quercetin has a much higher SPF value than anthocyanin, indicating greater photoprotective capabilities than anthocyanin.</p>
