							<h1>DPPH antioxidant test</h1>
                            <h2>Procedures</h2>
                            <p>1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazil (DPPH) is a free radical which produces a purple solution when dissolved in methanol. When it is reduced by antioxidants, a change in colouration from purple to yellow is observed. </p>
							<p>The negative control consisted of 1.0 ml of DPPH, 1.9 ml of methanol and 0.1 ml of saline solution. In the test set-ups, anthocyanin and quercetin replaced saline solution, respectively. Five replicates were prepared. For the respective blanks for each set-up, methanol was added instead of DPPH solution. The initial absorbance was measured at 517 nm against the respective blanks and the mixtures were then left to stand in the darkness for 20 min, before the final absorbance readings were measured. The radical scavenging activity (in %) was then calculated based on the following equation: </p>

						    <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>Figures 4 and 5 shows the absorbances of anthocyanin samples in the DPPH assay, in which 2 repeats were done. As can be seen, the anthocyanin sample has a lower absorbance than that of the control, indicating that there are lesser DPPH free radicals in the anthocyanin sample, as a result of the high antioxidant activity of anthocyanin.</p>

                            <p>Figures 6 and 7 shows the absorbances of quercetin samples in the DPPH assay, in which 2 repeats were done. As can be seen, the anthocyanin sample has a lower absorbance than that of the control, indicating that there are lesser DPPH free radicals in the anthocyanin sample, as a result of the antioxidant activity of anthocyanin, causing the DPPH solution to turn from purple to yellow. The absorbances of quercetin samples are even lower than that of the anthocyanin samples, indicating that quercetin has higher antioxidant activity than anthocyanin.</p>

                            <p>Figure 8 shows radical scavenging activities of anthocyanin and quercetin, which were calculated using the formula:</p>
                            <p>RSA (%) = (Final absorbance of control – Final absorbance of test)/Final absorbance of control x 100%</p>
                            <p>Quercetin has a much higher RSA than anthocyanin, indicating higher antioxidant activity than anthocyanin.</p>
