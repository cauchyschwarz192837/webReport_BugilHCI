							<h1>Effect of antioxidants on bacterium exposed to ultraviolet light</h1>
                            <h2>Procedure</h2>
                            <p>To test the effect of anthocyanin on bacterium exposed to UV radiation, <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells were inoculated into 15 ml of Luria-Bertani broth and incubated at 30°C in the shaking incubator for 24 h. The absorbance readings of the broth cultures were adjusted to 0.7 at 600 nm. The following set ups were then prepared:</p>
                            <p>Control set-up 1: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was added with equal volume of sterile water and left to stand for 20 min at room temperature.</p>
                              <p>Control set-up 2: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was added with equal volume of sterile water and left to stand for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then transferred into a Petri dish for UV exposure for 20 s. This tested the effect of UV light on the growth of <i>E. coli</i> in the absence of anthocyanin.</p>
                              <p>Control set-up 3: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was added with an equal volume of 0.1 mg/ml anthocyanin solution in water and left to stand for 20 min at room temperature. This tested the effect of anthocyanin on the growth of <i>E. coli</i>.</p>
                              <p>Test set-up: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture is added with equal volume of 0.1 mg/ml anthocyanin solution in water and left to stand for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was then transferred into a Petri dish for UV exposure for 20 s. This tested if the anthocyanin protected the cells from damage caused by free radicals from UV light.</p>
                            <p>Mixtures of control set-ups 1, 3 and the test set-up were serially diluted to 10-6, while mixtures of control set-up 2 were diluted to 10-2. 0.1 ml of the diluted broth cultures were spread evenly with a sterile spreader on LB agar. The plates were incubated at 30°C and the number of colony forming units was determined after 24 h.</p>
                            <h2>Results</h2>
                            <p>Figure 9 shows the number of colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml) in the anthocyanin colony count test. In the set-up which was exposed to UV radiation with only water, the absence of any colony forming units shows the bactericidal effect of UV radiation on <i>E. coli</i>. In the set-up which was exposed to UV radiation with anthocyanin, the presence of colony forming units shows that the <i>E. coli</i> bacteria were protected from the UV radiation by the anthocyanin, which possessed photoprotective capabilities. The Kruskal-Wallis test was performed and the p-value obtained was 0.000, which is less than 0.05, indicating significant statistical difference.</p>

                            <h2>Procedure</h2>
                            <p>To test the effect of quercetin on bacterium exposed to UV radiation, <i>E. coli</i> cells were inoculated into 15 ml of Luria-Bertani broth and incubated at 30°C in the shaking incubator for 24 h. The absorbance readings of the broth cultures were adjusted to 0.7 at 600 nm. The following set ups were then prepared:</p>
                            <p>Control set-up 1: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was left to stand for 20 min at room temperature.</p>
                            <p>Control set-up 2: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was left to stand for 20 min at room temperature, then transferred into a Petri dish and stacked above another Petri dish containing 5 ml of DMSO for UV exposure for 1 min. The UV radiation from the bottom of the UV transilluminator would have to pass through the DMSO to reach the <i>E. coli</i> above, allowing the DMSO to act as a barrier between the UV radiation and the <i>E. coli</i>. This tested the effect of DMSO as a barrier against UV light on the growth of <i>E. coli</i> in the absence of quercetin.</p>
                            <p>Test set-up: 3 ml of <i>E. coli</i> culture was left to stand for 20 min at room temperature, then transferred into a Petri dish and stacked above another Petri dish containing 5 ml of 0.1 mg/ml quercetin solution in DMSO for UV exposure for 1 min.
