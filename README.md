# Full Web Report (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js + Express Backend) with Embedded OpenAI LLM-Based Chatbot for AI-assisted Interpretation
## Quercetin and Anthocyanin as Potential Sunscreen Agents for Hair Photoprotection

This is the web report site for a biology experimental research project done at Bugil Academy, South Korea, and Hwa Chong Institution, Singapore.
Our research goals, methods, results, references and datalog (Node.js + Express backend) are made available here.

Designed an embedded chatbot powered by the OpenAI API (LLM-based), generating natural-language explanations of stored research logs by dynamically querying the database and constructing structured context for model inference. Command-based interaction model (with the date of the selected log chosen, type "!!!" and click "Send") to route the logged entry for AI-assisted interpretation and explanation. Specific questions can be typed following the "!!!" prefix
